# Reusable Components with ReactJS

I am making these components to reuse them in future projects...

## How do you start the development?

Download the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/davigsousa/reusable-comps.git
```
Enter in folder:
```
cd reusable-comps
```
Then, install all dependencies with yarn or NPM:
```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn
```
